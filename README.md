This Project i made is Book Reviewing: this project i made for user add a book the user was read before, also add some note for pages, edit it and delete. All i can say, this project have CRUD for the Database.

Instruction:

1. First of all, you need to add the npm packages for this project: "npm i". In this project i used: Express, Ejs, pg, body-parser.

2. Creating the Database name is book_review or anything else you want, in the book_preview (review i mean, grammar so wrong), I have provided the SQL file named book_review and it contained some tables I was wrote.

3. After you have done all of the things i was mention on the top, open the Terminal type: nodemon index.ejs, the project will run perfectly.

4. CAUTION, if you have any bugs, to change the database password, or username, host... in the index.ejs file at the db config section.

5. You are welcome to clone my repo, and if need anything to change in my code, just commit yours and i will consider it. Thank YOU!!!
